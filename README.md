# A NEAT Driving Simulator
3D simulation of cars learning to drive through a track using the NEAT algorithm (Neural Evolution through Augmenting Topologies) and the Unity game engine.
## Description

The NEAT algorithm was presented by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen, described in detail in their 2002 paper Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies.  NEAT  is  an  algorithm that  is  in  the  area  of  Neuroevolution  (NE),  which is the concept of evolving artificial neural networks using a genetic algorithm. What sets the NEAT algorithm apart from most NE algorithms is that it allows not only for the weights of the networks to be changed, but the topology of the networks themselves, as the name suggests.  This means that hidden nodes and connections between nodes can be added/removed.  The result will not necessarily have to be a fully connected neural network.

The implementation of the NEAT algorithm was also inspired by the following video series by Hydrozoa: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I1eG-WLLrY&list=PLdwBZvqyaXGZhGlL1H40qDoszkJctgzEC

The simulation is based on Udacity´s Self-Driving Car Simulator: https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim

It encorparates a 3D driving simulator
Modified an open source Unity driving simulator, and implemented the NEAT algorithm (Neural Evolution through Augmenting Topologies) in C# to teach cars to drive through a track.

## Test the simulation:
Run the scene file "Car.unity"
